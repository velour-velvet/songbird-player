## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed

#### Critical Production Stability Issues

- **502 Error Crash Loop Resolution**: Fixed infinite crash loop causing 502 Bad Gateway errors in production
  - Root cause: Missing production build (BUILD_ID file) causing Next.js to crash on startup
  - Added build validation check before server startup to prevent crash loops
  - Implemented automatic build recovery via PM2 pre-start hook
  - Created `scripts/ensure-build.js` for automatic build verification and creation
  - Process now fails gracefully with clear error messages instead of infinite restarts
  - Prevents PM2 from restarting when build is missing (stops crash loop)

#### Production Build Management

- **Build Validation System**: Comprehensive build validation before production startup
  - Validates `.next` directory existence
  - Verifies `BUILD_ID` file presence (required by Next.js)
  - Checks `.next/server` directory for complete build
  - Provides clear error messages guiding manual intervention if needed
  - Exits immediately if build is invalid (prevents crash loops)

- **Automatic Build Recovery**: PM2 pre-start hook ensures build exists before starting
  - Automatically runs `npm run build` if BUILD_ID is missing
  - Prevents manual intervention in most cases
  - Logs build process for debugging
  - Fails gracefully if build process fails

### Changed

- **PM2 Configuration**: Enhanced production process management
  - Added `pre_start` hook for automatic build verification
  - Improved restart timing (min_uptime: 30s, restart_delay: 5s, listen_timeout: 10s)
  - Added `wait_ready` flag for Next.js readiness detection
  - Configured health check URL for application-level monitoring
  - Health check grace period set to 5 seconds

- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in server script
  - Added null checks for error stack traces (TypeScript compliance)
  - Enhanced build validation error messages
  - Better logging for build-related failures

### Technical Improvements

- **Server Startup Flow**: Multi-layer defense against missing builds
  1. PM2 pre-start hook checks and builds if needed
  2. Server script validates build before starting Next.js
  3. Clear error messages if build is still missing
  4. Process exits cleanly (no infinite restart loops)

- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive 502 error analysis documentation
  - Root cause analysis of crash loop issue
  - Step-by-step fix implementation
  - Testing and verification procedures
  - Prevention measures and monitoring recommendations

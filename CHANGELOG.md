## [0.8.2] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

#### Search Results Persistence Bug

- **Stale Search Results**: Fixed issue where top 1-2 results from previous searches would stick at the top when performing multiple searches in a row
  - Root cause: Search results were not cleared immediately when starting a new search, allowing old results to persist until new API response arrived
  - Solution: Clear results immediately when starting any new search operation
  - Applied to all search functions: `performSearch`, `handleArtistClick`, `handleAlbumClick`, and `handleShufflePlay`
  - Results now clear instantly when a new search starts, preventing stale data from showing
  - Location: `src/app/HomePageClient.tsx:67-97, 276-311, 99-157, 316-350`

#### Rapid Pause/Unpause Bug

- **Audio Player State Loop**: Fixed critical bug where audio would rapidly pause and unpause (~10 times per second) requiring page refresh
  - Root cause: Multiple issues causing feedback loops between React state and audio element state:
    1. State sync polling creating feedback loops
    2. Event handlers firing without guards against rapid state changes
    3. Race conditions between React state updates and audio element state
  - Solution: Implemented comprehensive guards to prevent rapid state changes:
    - Added `isPlayPauseOperationRef` to track in-progress play/pause operations
    - Added guards to `play()` and `pause()` functions to prevent concurrent operations
    - Enhanced event handlers (`handlePlay`, `handlePause`) to only update state when actually different
    - Improved state sync polling with debouncing (200ms minimum between syncs)
    - Updated media session handlers to use guarded functions
    - Added ref-based state tracking to avoid stale closures
  - Play/pause operations now properly guarded against rapid toggling
  - State sync mechanism prevents feedback loops
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:64-66, 404-417, 626-738, 740-756, 1278-1290, 288-300`

#### Queue Persistence Issues

- **Queue Refilling After Tab Switch**: Fixed queue being restored after clearing when switching tabs
  - Root cause: `clearQueue` only cleared in-memory state but didn't clear persisted localStorage, causing restoration on remount
  - Solution: 
    - `clearQueue` now immediately clears localStorage when queue becomes empty
    - Added guard in load effect to prevent restoring empty queues (intentionally cleared)
    - `clearQueueAndHistory` also clears persisted state
  - Clearing queue is now final - it stays cleared even after tab switches
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1017-1025, 1446-1458, 109-160`

### Added

#### Database Queue Persistence for Logged-In Users

- **Queue State Persistence**: Added comprehensive queue persistence system supporting both database (logged-in users) and localStorage (non-logged-in users)
  - **Database Schema**: Added `queueState` JSONB field to `userPreferences` table
    - Stores complete queue state including queuedTracks, smartQueueState, history, shuffle, and repeat mode
    - Location: `src/server/db/schema.ts:242-252`
  - **API Endpoints**: Added three new tRPC endpoints for queue state management
    - `saveQueueState` - Saves queue state to database (debounced, 1 second)
    - `getQueueState` - Retrieves queue state from database
    - `clearQueueState` - Clears queue state from database
    - Location: `src/server/api/routers/music.ts:813-880`
  - **Automatic Sync**: Queue state automatically syncs between database and localStorage
    - Logged-in users: Queue saved to database, restored on login
    - Non-logged-in users: Queue saved to localStorage (existing behavior)
    - Priority: Database (if logged in) > localStorage (if not logged in)
    - Location: `src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx:99-105, 235-285`
  - **Initial State Restoration**: Added `initialQueueState` option to `useAudioPlayer` hook
    - Allows restoring queue from database on component mount
    - Prevents overwriting active queue when restoring
    - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:15-25, 27-28, 109-160`
  - **Smart Clearing**: Queue clearing now works in both storage locations
    - When queue is cleared, it's removed from both database and localStorage
    - Empty queues are not restored (intentionally cleared state)
    - Location: `src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx:260-285`

### Changed

#### Queue Persistence Architecture

- **Dual Storage System**: Queue now persists in appropriate storage based on authentication status
  - Logged-in users: Database persistence with automatic sync
  - Non-logged-in users: localStorage persistence (unchanged)
  - Seamless transition between storage methods on login/logout
  - Location: `src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx:235-285`

### Technical Details

**Search Results Fix:**
- All search functions now call `setResults([])` and `setTotal(0)` immediately when starting
- Prevents race conditions where previous search responses could arrive after new search starts
- Ensures clean state for every new search operation

**Audio Player State Management:**
- Operation guards prevent concurrent play/pause operations
- Event handlers use refs to avoid stale closure issues
- State sync polling includes debouncing to prevent rapid updates
- Media session handlers use guarded functions instead of direct audio manipulation

**Queue Persistence Flow:**
1. On mount: Load from database (if logged in) or localStorage (if not logged in)
2. On change: Save to appropriate storage (debounced for database, immediate for localStorage)
3. On clear: Remove from both storage locations
4. On tab switch: Restore only if queue has actual tracks (not empty/cleared)

**Database Migration Required:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE "hexmusic-stream_user_preferences" 
ADD COLUMN "queueState" jsonb DEFAULT NULL;
```

**Files Modified:**
- Modified: `src/app/HomePageClient.tsx` (search results clearing)
- Modified: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` (pause/unpause guards, queue clearing, initial state support)
- Modified: `src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx` (database queue persistence)
- Modified: `src/server/db/schema.ts` (queueState field)
- Modified: `src/server/api/routers/music.ts` (queue state API endpoints)

- **EnhancedTrackCard**: Replaced inline playlist dropdown with modal
  - Removed playlist query and mutation (now handled by modal)
  - Replaced dropdown menu (lines 272-318) with button + modal
  - Net change: -30 lines (cleaner component)
  - Location: `src/components/EnhancedTrackCard.tsx`

- **TrackCard**: Replaced inline playlist dropdown with modal
  - Same pattern as EnhancedTrackCard
  - Net change: -23 lines
  - Location: `src/components/TrackCard.tsx`

- **SwipeableTrackCard**: Integrated modal while preserving "Play Next" functionality
  - Modified menu to keep "Play Next" button

  - Net change: +5 lines (preserved existing functionality)
  - Location: `src/components/SwipeableTrackCard.tsx`

#### Desktop Player

- **Player (MaturePlayer)**: Integrated Add to Playlist modal
  - Removed inline playlist dropdown
  - Replaced with modal-based UI (matching mobile UX)
  - Removed playlist query and mutation (lines 112-127)
  - Replaced dropdown section (lines 264-339) with button + modal
  - Location: `src/components/Player.tsx`

### Fixed

#### Add to Playlist Modal Z-Index and Authentication

- **Modal Not Visible**: Fixed z-index hierarchy so modal always appears on top
  - Changed backdrop from z-70 to z-100
  - Changed modal from z-71 to z-101 (highest in app)
  - Now appears above mobile player (z-98-99) and all other UI elements
  - Location: `src/components/AddToPlaylistModal.tsx:137,150`

- **Authentication Handling**: Added proper authentication checks
  - Modal now detects if user is signed in
  - Shows "Sign in to create playlists" message for unauthenticated users
  - Query only runs when both modal is open AND user is authenticated
  - Prevents unnecessary API calls for logged-out users
  - Location: `src/components/AddToPlaylistModal.tsx:37-38,44,196-215,247`

#### Skip Forward/Backward Buttons

- **Non-Finite Value Error**: Fixed `TypeError: Failed to set the 'currentTime' property on 'HTMLMediaElement': The provided double value is non-finite`
  - Root cause: When audio duration is `NaN` or `Infinity`, skip functions calculated non-finite values
  - Solution: Added triple-layer validation to prevent NaN values from reaching seek function
  - Defense in depth approach:
    1. Validate `seconds` parameter (fallback to 10 if invalid)
    2. Validate `currentTime` and `duration` from audio element
    3. Validate calculated `newTime` before calling seek
    4. Final validation in `seek()` function itself
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:713-724` - seek() validates time parameter
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1165-1194` - skipForward() triple validation
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1196-1224` - skipBackward() triple validation

#### Playlist Detail Page Actions

- **Action Buttons Hidden for Playlist Owners**: Fixed EnhancedTrackCard not showing action buttons on playlist detail pages when viewing your own playlists
  - Root cause: Playlist detail page passed `showActions={!isOwner}`, hiding all action buttons for playlist owners
  - Impact: Prevented users from:
    - Adding tracks to other playlists (the original user request)
    - Adding tracks to queue
    - Favoriting tracks
    - Sharing tracks
  - Solution: Changed to `showActions={true}` to always show action buttons regardless of ownership
  - Now playlist owners can organize tracks from their playlists into other thematic playlists
  - Location: `src/app/playlists/[id]/page.tsx:534`

### Technical Details

**Modal Architecture:**

- Z-index hierarchy: Modal (z-100/z-101) highest in app, above all elements
- Query optimization: Only fetches playlist data when modal is open AND user is authenticated
- Client-side search: useMemo for efficient filtering without server calls
- Responsive design: Mobile-first with max-width constraint (28rem) on desktop
- Authentication: Shows sign-in prompt for unauthenticated users

**User Experience Improvements:**

- Consistent UI across mobile and desktop platforms
- Reduced visual clutter by replacing inline dropdowns
- Better discoverability of playlists (search + visual status indicators)
- Prevents duplicate additions (checkmarks + disabled state)

**Files Modified:**

- New: `src/contexts/TrackContextMenuContext.tsx` - Context menu state provider

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

#### Audio Player State Synchronization

- **Pause Button Not Working**: Fixed infinite play/pause loop caused by React state being out of sync with audio element state
  - Root cause: useEffect dependency on `isPlaying` triggered when user paused, causing immediate auto-play
  - Solution: Removed `isPlaying` from dependency array and eliminated auto-play for already-loaded tracks
  - Added polling mechanism (500ms) to sync React state with actual audio element state
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:694-711` - togglePlay checks actual audio state
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1080` - Removed isPlaying from dependency array
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1084-1096` - Added state sync polling

#### Visualizer Animation Lifecycle

- **Visualizer Not Responding to Play/Pause**: Fixed animation loop not starting/stopping with playback
  - Root cause: Animation loop only triggered on audioElement changes, not play/pause state changes
  - Solution: Added play/pause event listeners to track audio state and trigger animation loop
  - Animation now properly starts when playing and stops when paused
  - Locations:
    - `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:32-57` - Added play/pause event listeners
    - `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:150-154` - Animation loop depends on isPlaying state
    - `src/components/PersistentPlayer.tsx:294-297` - Fixed prop mismatch (audioElement vs analyser/audioContext)

#### Browser Autoplay Policy Compliance

- **NotAllowedError on Page Load**: Fixed browser blocking audio autoplay on initial page load
  - Solution: Skip auto-play on first render when restoring queue from localStorage
  - User must explicitly click play or select a song for audio to start
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1052-1056` - Skip auto-play on initial mount
    - `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:112-122` - Initialize audio source without playing

### Technical Details

**State Synchronization Architecture:**

- Audio element's `.paused` property is now the source of truth
- React `isPlaying` state synced via:
  1. Audio element event listeners (play/pause events)
  2. Polling fallback (500ms) to catch missed events
  3. Direct checks in togglePlay and visualizer
- UI button icons always match actual playback state

**Visualizer Event-Driven Updates:**

```
Audio Element Events → FlowFieldBackground State → Animation Loop
     play event      →   setIsPlaying(true)     →   Start animating
    pause event      →   setIsPlaying(false)    →   Stop animating
```

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` - State sync, autoplay prevention, pause button fix
- Modified: `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx` - Event-driven animation, play/pause tracking
- Modified: `src/components/PersistentPlayer.tsx` - Fixed visualizer props

## [0.7.9] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

#### Audio Context Stability

- **Critical Audio Context Error**: Resolved `InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'createMediaElementSource'`
  - Fixed conflict where both equalizer and visualizer were creating separate MediaElementSource nodes
  - Browser limitation: Only ONE MediaElementSource allowed per HTMLMediaElement
  - Implemented shared audio graph architecture with single source node
  - Locations:
    - `src/hooks/useEqualizer.ts:51,201-212,390-391` - Added analyser node to equalizer chain
    - `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:8-13,15-23` - Simplified to use shared analyser
    - `src/components/PersistentPlayer.tsx:293-300` - Wired shared analyser between components

### Technical Details

**Previous Architecture (Broken):**

```
Audio Element → useEqualizer creates source → filters → destination
Audio Element → FlowFieldBackground creates source → analyser → destination
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                ERROR: Can't create 2nd source from same element!
```

**New Architecture (Fixed):**

```
Audio Element → useEqualizer creates ONE source → filters → analyser → destination
                                                              ↑
                                                 FlowFieldBackground uses this
```

**Audio Chain Flow:**

- Single `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` created in `useEqualizer`
- Connected through 9 equalizer filter nodes
- Flows to `AnalyserNode` (shared with visualizer)
- Finally connects to `AudioContext.destination` (speakers)
- When equalizer disabled: source connects directly to analyser (bypassing filters)

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates dual source node creation errors
- Maintains equalizer functionality (10-band EQ, presets)
- Preserves visualizer audio reactivity (flow field patterns)
- Cleaner architecture with single source of truth
- Proper resource cleanup on unmount

## [0.7.8] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

#### Audio Player Controls

- **Pause Button Reliability**: Enhanced pause functionality with proper error handling
  - Added audio element initialization check before pausing
  - Implemented try-catch error handling to prevent pause failures
  - Added logging to help diagnose playback issues
  - Ensures isPlaying state always syncs correctly with audio element
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:551-567`

- **Queue Clearing on Track End**: Fixed queue not clearing when single song finishes playing
  - When a track ends with no more tracks in queue, the queue is now properly cleared
  - Prevents stale track from remaining in queue after playback completes
  - Added logging to confirm queue clearing behavior
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:156-165`

### Technical Details

**Pause Function Enhancement:**

The pause function now includes comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
const pause = useCallback(() => {
  if (!audioRef.current) {
    console.warn("[useAudioPlayer] Cannot pause: audio element not initialized");
    setIsPlaying(false);
    return;
  }

  try {
    audioRef.current.pause();
    setIsPlaying(false);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[useAudioPlayer] Error pausing audio:", error);
    setIsPlaying(false);
  }
}, []);
```

**Queue Clearing Logic:**

When `handleTrackEnd()` is called with no remaining tracks in queue:

```typescript
} else {
  // No more tracks in queue, playback ends
  onTrackEnd?.(currentTrack);
  // Clear the queue since playback is complete
  setQueue([]);
  setIsPlaying(false);
  console.log("[useAudioPlayer] 🏁 Playback ended, queue cleared");
}
```

**Benefits:**

- More reliable pause/play toggling
- Cleaner queue state management
- Better user experience when playing single tracks
- Improved debugging with enhanced logging

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` (pause function + queue clearing logic)

## [0.7.7] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

#### Critical Audio Context Stability Issue

- **Visualizer Toggle Error Resolution**: Fixed critical `InvalidStateError` when toggling visualizer on/off
  - Root cause: HTMLAudioElement can only be connected to one MediaElementSourceNode (browser limitation)
  - When visualizer was toggled off and back on, component remounted and attempted to reconnect the same audio element
  - This caused `InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'createMediaElementSource'` errors requiring page reload
  - **Solution**: Implemented global WeakMap to track connected audio elements and reuse existing connections
  - Audio element connections now persist across component lifecycle changes
  - Visualizer can be toggled on/off without errors or page reloads
  - Location: `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx:27-70`

#### Profile Page Authentication Errors

- **UNAUTHORIZED Error Elimination**: Fixed excessive UNAUTHORIZED errors when viewing profile pages
  - Root cause: Track card components (`EnhancedTrackCard`, `TrackCard`, `Player`) were calling authenticated endpoints (`music.isFavorite`, `music.getPlaylists`) without checking authentication status
  - When viewing someone else's profile (or when not logged in), these queries were called and failed with UNAUTHORIZED
  - This caused hundreds of error logs and degraded performance
  - **Solution**: Added authentication checks using `useSession` hook before calling protected endpoints
  - Queries now only execute when user is authenticated
  - Eliminated all UNAUTHORIZED errors on public profile pages
  - Components gracefully handle unauthenticated state (favorite/playlist features simply unavailable)
  - Location: `src/components/EnhancedTrackCard.tsx:32-35, 59-61`
  - Location: `src/components/TrackCard.tsx:36-39, 63-65`
  - Location: `src/components/Player.tsx:85-88, 109-111`

### Changed

#### Pattern Controls Enhancement

- **Pattern Duration Range**: Increased maximum pattern duration from 1000 to 10000 frames
  - Minimum remains at 10 frames (default unchanged)
  - Allows for much longer pattern displays for extended viewing
  - Updated validation in FlowFieldRenderer to accept new range (10-10000)
  - Location: `src/components/PatternControls.tsx:306-319`
  - Location: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts:10969-10971`

### Technical Details

**Audio Context Connection Management:**

The fix implements a global WeakMap to track audio elements that have been connected to MediaElementSourceNodes:

```typescript
const connectedAudioElements = new WeakMap<
  HTMLAudioElement,
  {
    sourceNode: MediaElementAudioSourceNode;
    audioContext: AudioContext;
    analyser: AnalyserNode;
  }
>();
```

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Connection Reuse**: When FlowFieldBackground remounts with the same audio element, it reuses the existing connection instead of attempting to create a new one
2. **Global Tracking**: WeakMap ensures connections persist across component unmounts/remounts
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Source nodes are never disconnected from audio elements (they can't be reconnected), only component refs are reset
4. **Error Prevention**: Eliminates all `InvalidStateError` exceptions related to audio context

**Authentication-Aware Query Execution:**

All track card components now check authentication before calling protected endpoints:

```typescript
const { data: session } = useSession();
const isAuthenticated = !!session;

const { data: favoriteData } = api.music.isFavorite.useQuery(
  { trackId: track.id },
  { enabled: showActions && isAuthenticated },
);
```

**Benefits:**

- Zero UNAUTHORIZED errors on public profile pages
- Reduced server load (no unnecessary failed queries)
- Cleaner console logs
- Better user experience (no error spam)
- Graceful degradation for unauthenticated users

**Files Modified:**

- Modified: `src/components/FlowFieldBackground.tsx` (audio context connection management)
- Modified: `src/components/EnhancedTrackCard.tsx` (authentication checks)
- Modified: `src/components/TrackCard.tsx` (authentication checks)
- Modified: `src/components/Player.tsx` (authentication checks)
- Modified: `src/components/PatternControls.tsx` (pattern duration range)
- Modified: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts` (pattern duration validation)
- Modified: `package.json` (version bump to 0.7.7)

### Stability Improvements Summary

This release focuses on **critical stability improvements** that eliminate errors and improve reliability:

1. **Visualizer Toggle Stability**: Users can now toggle the visualizer on/off without encountering errors or needing to reload the page
2. **Profile Page Stability**: Public profile pages load without generating hundreds of UNAUTHORIZED errors
3. **Error Reduction**: Eliminated all `InvalidStateError` and UNAUTHORIZED errors related to audio context and authentication
4. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls and error handling overhead
5. **User Experience**: Smoother interactions with no error spam in console logs

These fixes address fundamental stability issues that were causing user-facing errors and requiring page reloads.

  - Graceful error handling for trigger operations
  - ES module compatibility fixes (`__dirname` replacement with `import.meta.url`)
  - JSONB column type detection and proper serialization
  - Enhanced error messages with context

- **Migration Safety Features**:
  - Schema validation before starting migration
  - Table count verification (warns if target has fewer tables)
  - Row-by-row error handling (continues on individual row failures)
  - Transaction-based batch processing for data integrity
  - Automatic conflict resolution (prevents duplicate inserts)

### Technical Details

**Migration Script Features:**

- **Table Discovery**: Automatically discovers all tables from source database
- **Dependency Ordering**: Uses topological sort to determine correct migration order based on foreign key relationships
- **Batch Processing**: Processes data in batches of 1000 rows for optimal performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with colored output showing:
  - Table being migrated
  - Row counts
  - Success/failure status
  - Total progress (X/17 tables)
- **Data Verification**: After migration, verifies row counts match between source and target
- **Error Recovery**: Individual row failures don't stop the entire migration
- **JSONB Handling**: Properly serializes JavaScript objects to JSON strings for JSONB columns
- **Sequence Management**: Automatically resets sequences to prevent ID conflicts

**NEON-Specific Adaptations:**

- **System Triggers**: NEON Postgres doesn't allow disabling system triggers (referential integrity constraints)
  - Solution: Only disable user-defined triggers, let PostgreSQL handle constraints naturally
  - Migration order ensures foreign keys are respected
- **SSL Configuration**: Automatic SSL configuration for NEON connections
  - Detects NEON connection strings
  - Uses lenient SSL (rejectUnauthorized: false) for NEON
  - Supports custom CA certificates if needed

**Migration Process:**

1. **Pre-Migration Checks**:
   - Validates source and target database connections
   - Verifies schema exists on target database
   - Discovers all tables and counts rows
   - Shows migration summary before starting

2. **Migration Execution**:
   - Migrates tables in dependency order (parents before children)
   - Processes data in batches for performance
   - Handles JSONB columns with proper serialization
   - Skips rows with invalid JSON (logs warning, continues)
   - Resets sequences after each table

3. **Post-Migration Verification**:
   - Compares row counts between source and target
   - Reports any mismatches
   - Provides success confirmation

**Usage Example:**

```bash
# Set target database URL
export TARGET_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@neon-host/db?sslmode=require"

# Run migration
npm run migrate:neon
```

**Files Modified:**

- Added: `scripts/migrate-to-neon.ts` (migration script, 477 lines)
- Added: `scripts/MIGRATION_README.md` (migration documentation)
- Modified: `package.json` (added `migrate:neon` script, version bump to 0.7.6)

**Migration Safety:**

- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate rows
- Safe to re-run if migration is interrupted
- Already migrated tables are skipped automatically
- Transaction-based batching ensures data integrity

## [0.7.5] - 2025-12-29

### Added

  - Changed `NextRequest` import to `import type` for better tree-shaking
  - Added eslint disable comments for intentional img usage in edge runtime
  - Location: `src/app/api/og/route.tsx:4, 42`

### Technical Details

**PM2 Fork Mode Rationale:**

Next.js has built-in concurrency handling via Node.js async I/O. Cluster mode causes:

- Port binding conflicts (each instance tries to bind to same port)
- Excessive database connections (instances × pool size)
- Unnecessary complexity for Next.js architecture

Fork mode provides:

- Single optimized instance with automatic crash recovery
- Zero-downtime deployments via graceful reload
- Better resource utilization
- Simpler monitoring and debugging

**Shadow Realm Optimization Implementation:**

```typescript
const layers = 18;
for (let layer = 0; layer < layers; layer++) {
  ctx.shadowBlur = baseShadowBlur;
  ctx.shadowColor = this.hsla(hue, 95, 40, 0.7);
  ctx.strokeStyle = this.hsla(hue, 85, avgLightness, avgAlpha);

  ctx.beginPath();
  for (let i = 0; i < segments; i++) {
    ctx.moveTo(x, y);
    ctx.arc(0, 0, radius, angle, nextAngle);
  }
  ctx.stroke();
}
```

**Infernal Flame Optimization Implementation:**

```typescript
for (let layer = 0; layer < 2; layer++) {
  ctx.shadowBlur = layerShadowBlur;
  ctx.shadowColor = this.hsla(layerHue, 100, 70, 0.7);

  for (let flame = 0; flame < flames; flame++) {
    ctx.fillStyle = this.hsla(hueBase, 100, 70, flameAlpha);
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fill();
  }
}

for (let i = 0; i < emberCount; i++) {
  ctx.fillStyle = this.hsla(emberHue, 100, 80, emberAlpha);
  ctx.fillRect(baseX - halfSize, baseY - halfSize, emberSize, emberSize);
}
```

**Files Modified:**

  - Location: `src/components/visualizers/FlowFieldRenderer.ts:220-243, 1981-2112`

### Technical Details

**Fireworks Optimization Implementation:**

```typescript
// Object pooling system
private fireworks: { x, y, vx, vy, hue, life, maxLife, size, dead }[] = [];
private fireworksPool: [...same structure...] = [];
private fireworksActiveCount = 0;
private fireworksCleanupCounter = 0;

// Mark particles dead instead of splice
if (fw.life > fw.maxLife) {
  fw.dead = true;
  this.fireworksActiveCount--;
  this.fireworksPool.push(fw);
  continue;
}

// Periodic cleanup every 120 frames
this.fireworksCleanupCounter++;
if (this.fireworksCleanupCounter > 120) {
  this.fireworksCleanupCounter = 0;
  this.fireworks = this.fireworks.filter((fw) => !fw.dead);
}

// Simplified rendering (no gradients)
ctx.arc(fw.x, fw.y, fw.size, 0, TAU);        // Core
ctx.arc(fw.x, fw.y, fw.size * 2, 0, TAU);    // Medium glow
ctx.arc(fw.x, fw.y, fw.size * 3, 0, TAU);    // Outer glow
```

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

#### Critical Queue Bug #1: Partial Playlist Save (2, 4, 6 songs pattern)

- **Playlist Save Functionality**: Fixed severe bug where saving queue to playlist only saved partial tracks (2, 4, 6 pattern)
  - Root cause: Sequential `await` loop with potential race conditions
  - Changed from sequential execution to parallel `Promise.all` execution
  - Ensures **all tracks** are saved atomically without race conditions
  - Added detailed logging for each track being added (e.g., "Adding track 1/50: Song Title")
  - Location: `src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx:367-382`
  - Impact: Users can now reliably save their entire queue to playlists

#### Critical Queue Bug #2: Queue Destruction on Manual Play

- **Queue Preservation**: Fixed catastrophic bug where playing a new track manually **destroyed the entire queue**
  - Root cause: `setQueue([track])` completely replaced queue instead of inserting track
  - Impact: Users lost hours of work when manually playing a single track (100+ song queues gone instantly)
  - Fix: Changed to `setQueue([track, ...queue.slice(1)])` - inserts new track at position 0, preserves rest of queue
  - Queue behavior now:
    - If track **NOT** in queue: Inserts at position 0, shifts everything else down
    - If track **IN** queue: Moves it to position 0 (existing behavior)
    - **Your queue stays intact** - no more losing hours of curation work
  - Added comprehensive logging to track queue operations:
    - "Playing new track, inserting at queue position 0, preserving existing queue"
    - "Track already playing, restarting from beginning"
    - "Track found in queue at position X, playing from queue"
  - Location: `src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts:1071-1085`

### Changed

#### Queue Resilience & Reliability

- **Queue Management**: Queue is now **much less brittle** and more robust
  - Manual track playback preserves existing queue
  - Playlist save operations are atomic and reliable
  - Enhanced logging throughout queue operations for debugging
  - Queue structure maintained: `queue[0]` = current track, `queue[1..n]` = upcoming tracks

### Technical Details

**Queue Structure:**

- Current track is always at `queue[0]`
- Upcoming tracks are at `queue[1..n]`
- History tracking works correctly with preserved queue

**Playlist Save Fix:**

```typescript
// OLD - Sequential, could have race conditions
for (const track of tracksToSave) {
  await addToPlaylistMutation.mutateAsync({ ... });
}

// NEW - All tracks added in parallel, atomic operation
await Promise.all(
  tracksToSave.map((track, index) => {
    console.log(`Adding track ${index + 1}/${tracksToSave.length}: ${track.title}`);
    return addToPlaylistMutation.mutateAsync({
      playlistId: playlist.id,
      track,
    });
  }),
);
```

**Queue Preservation Fix:**

```typescript
// OLD - DESTROYS the queue! 💀
setQueue([track]); // 100 carefully selected songs = GONE

// NEW - Preserves your precious queue! 🎉
setQueue([track, ...queue.slice(1)]); // Keep queue[1..n], replace queue[0]
```

### User Impact

**Before this fix:**

- Saving a 50-song queue to playlist might only save 2, 4, or 6 songs
- Playing a new track manually would wipe your entire 100+ song queue
- Users lost hours of work assembling queues

**After this fix:**

- All tracks in queue are reliably saved to playlists
- Playing new tracks preserves your carefully assembled queue
- Queue feels solid and reliable, not fragile and prone to destruction

  - **Spectral Echo**: reduced layers/segments, added temporal subsampling, removed particle/beam gradients and trails, and simplified the core.
  - **Twilight Zone**: removed per-zone gradients; replaced with cheap ring strokes + sparse sparkles and fewer wisps/core layers.
  - **Demonic Gate**: reduced particle/entity/tendril/sigil counts, removed tendril gradients, simplified sigils, and reduced shadow costs.
  - **Shadow Dance**: removed trail/beam gradients, reduced dancer complexity, simplified trails/wisps, and reduced center layers.
